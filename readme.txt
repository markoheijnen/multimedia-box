Enable an API to register multimedia box for a specific post type

== Description ==

When you've got lots of post meta-boxes, your post edit screen can become difficult to search. Make your post edit screen easier to navigate and manage by creating a set of tabs, with the Tabify Edit Screen plugin. And manage it all from the WordPress back-end!

The plugin is still in active development, and I'm always looking for ways to improve it. 

Known issue: currently the plugin ignores the "show on screen" values from the Screen options. I'm currently working to fix this issue.


== Installation ==

1. Upload the folder `multimedia-box` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Use the API code in your own plugin/theme to enable a multimedia box for a specific post type
